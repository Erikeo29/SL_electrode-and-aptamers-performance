### Results analysis — study 1: electrode parameters

The plots below show the influence of the four surface parameters (RF, exposed Ni, exposed Cu, contamination) on SWV voltammogram metrics. Key observations:

- **Exposed nickel (dominant factor)**: SNR drops by a factor of $\sim 10$ between 0 and 10% exposed Ni. This results from parasitic currents generated by nickel and the reduction of the effective rate constant $k^0_{eff}$. This is the most critical parameter for biosensor quality.

- **Roughness factor (RF)**: baseline current $I_{baseline}$ increases proportionally with RF, while $I_{peak}$ shows an optimum around RF $= 1.5$. Beyond this, the increase in capacitive noise degrades SNR despite higher faradaic current.

- **Contamination**: linear and proportional effect. At 30% blocked sites, peak current is reduced by approximately one third, consistent with the reduction of $\Gamma_{eff}$.

- **Exposed copper**: measurable but clearly secondary effect compared to nickel at pH 7.4 (PBS buffer). Copper contributes weakly to the background current.
