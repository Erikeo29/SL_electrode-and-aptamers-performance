### Results analysis — study 2: SWV frequency

The plots below show the evolution of SWV metrics as a function of frequency (10 to 500 Hz), for different RF and exposed Ni combinations. Key observations:

- **$I_{peak}$ vs frequency**: approximately linear growth for clean electrodes (Ni = 0%), confirming the quasi-reversible regime. Marked sub-linearity for electrodes with exposed Ni, indicating a transition towards irreversibility.

- **$E_{peak}$ and FWHM**: stable at low frequency, then negative shift of $E_{peak}$ and FWHM broadening at high frequency. The effect is amplified by nickel exposure (reduction of $k^0_{eff}$).

- **SNR vs frequency**: bell-shaped profile — SNR initially increases with frequency (signal gain) then degrades above 100–200 Hz (peak broadening, irreversible transition). The optimal frequency depends on surface condition: 25–100 Hz for a clean electrode, 10–25 Hz for a degraded electrode.

- **Kinetic parameter $K$**: hyperbolic decrease ($K = k^0_{eff}/f$) mapping the kinetic regime for each condition.
