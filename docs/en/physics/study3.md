In practice, the connection between the working electrode and the potentiostat is never perfect: solution resistance, imperfect electrical contacts and surface films introduce an uncompensated resistance $R_u$.

## 1. Physics of uncompensated resistance

### 1.1 Origin of $R_u$

The uncompensated resistance is the total resistance between the working electrode and the reference electrode that is not corrected by the potentiostat. It arises from several sources:

- **Solution resistance**: proportional to the electrode--reference distance and inversely proportional to the buffer conductivity.
- **Contact resistance**: defective electrical connections, contact corrosion.
- **Film resistance**: passivation layer or deposit on the electrode.

### 1.2 Ohmic drop ($IR$ drop)

When a current $I$ passes through the resistance $R_u$, the potential actually applied at the electrode--solution interface differs from the potential imposed by the potentiostat:

$$E_{real} = E_{applied} - I \times R_u$$

The ohmic drop $IR_{drop} = I \times R_u$ causes:

1. **Peak potential shift**: the peak shifts in the direction of the reaction (toward more negative potentials in reduction).
2. **Peak broadening**: the potential distribution across the electrode surface is modified, widening the FWHM.
3. **Apparent peak current reduction**: the broadened peak contains the same charge but with reduced amplitude.

### 1.3 Order of magnitude

For the aptamer biosensor at 25 Hz, typical currents are on the order of nanoamperes:

| $R_u$ ($\Omega$) | Typical $I_{peak}$ (nA) | $IR_{drop}$ (mV) | Impact |
|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 0 | 50 | 0 | None |
| 50 | 50 | 0.0025 | Negligible |
| 100 | 50 | 0.005 | Negligible |
| 200 | 50 | 0.010 | Negligible |
| 500 | 50 | 0.025 | Small |
| 1000 | 50 | 0.050 | Moderate |

At 25 Hz with nanoampere-level currents, the ohmic drop remains moderate even for $R_u = 1000\;\Omega$. However, the effect of $R_u$ is not limited to simple $IR$ drop: uncompensated resistance also modifies the shape of the SWV signal by filtering the fast current components.

### 1.4 RC filtering effect

The uncompensated resistance, combined with the double-layer capacitance $C_{dl}$, forms an RC filter:

$$\tau_{RC} = R_u \times C_{dl}$$

If $\tau_{RC}$ is comparable to the pulse duration $\left(\frac{1}{2f}\right)$, the current does not reach its steady-state value before sampling, which distorts the voltammogram. This effect is more pronounced at high frequency, but in this study the frequency is fixed at 25 Hz (pulse duration = 20 ms), which generally provides enough time for RC relaxation.

### 1.5 FWHM broadening with $R_u$

FWHM increases with $R_u$ according to a relationship that depends on the mechanism:

- For low currents (nA), broadening is primarily due to potential redistribution across the heterogeneous surface.
- Broadening is more pronounced for high-RF electrodes (larger currents, hence greater $IR$ drop).

## 2. $R_u$--electrode interactions

### 2.1 RF $\times$ $R_u$ interaction

High-RF electrodes produce larger currents (greater real surface area), which amplifies the $R_u$ effect:

$$IR_{drop}(\text{RF},\, R_u) = I_{peak}(\text{RF}) \times R_u \;\sim\; \text{RF} \times R_u$$

Thus, a very rough electrode ($\text{RF} = 3$) at $R_u = 1000\;\Omega$ experiences an ohmic drop three times greater than a flat electrode ($\text{RF} = 1$) under the same conditions.

### 2.2 Ni $\times$ $R_u$ interaction

Nickel exposure reduces $I_{peak}$ (via reduced $k^0_{eff}$ and parasitic currents). Paradoxically, this also reduces the faradaic $IR$ drop. However, the parasitic currents generated by Ni also contribute to the ohmic drop across $R_u$, so the net effect depends on the balance between these two contributions.

| Condition | Relative $I_{peak}$ | $IR_{drop}$ at $R_u = 1000\;\Omega$ | Net effect |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| Ni = 0 %, RF = 1 | Reference | Small | Minimal |
| Ni = 0 %, RF = 3 | $\times 3$ | $\times 3$ | Significant |
| Ni = 10 %, RF = 1 | Reduced | Very small | Parasitic currents dominant |
| Ni = 10 %, RF = 3 | Reduced but amplified by RF | Moderate | Signal/noise competition |

## 3. Experimental design

### 3.1 Objective

This study examines the influence of uncompensated resistance ($R_u$) on the voltammetric response of the aptamer biosensor, in interaction with electrode surface parameters (RF and exposed Ni). The goal is to quantify signal distortion caused by the ohmic drop and to evaluate the biosensor's robustness under non-ideal contact conditions.

### 3.2 Factors and levels

| Factor | Levels | Values |
|--------|--------|--------|
| RF | 3 | 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 |
| $\text{Ni}_{exposed}$ | 3 | 0, 5, 10 % |
| $R_u$ | 6 | 0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 $\Omega$ |

### 3.3 Total number of combinations

$$3 \;(\text{RF}) \times 3 \;(\text{Ni}) \times 6 \;(R_u) = 54 \text{ combinations}$$

### 3.4 Fixed parameters

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Frequency | 25 Hz | Reference frequency |
| $\text{Cu}_{exposed}$ | 0 % | Isolate $R_u$ effect |
| Contamination | 0 % | Clean surface |
| $\delta E_s$ | 4 mV | Standard SWV |
| $\delta E_p$ | 25 mV | Standard SWV |

## 4. Expected results and practical conclusion

### 4.1 Summary by metric

| Metric | Expected behaviour |
|--------|-------------------|
| $IR_{drop}$ vs $R_u$ | Linear relationship; slope $\propto I_{peak}$ |
| $E_{peak}$ vs $R_u$ | Linear shift toward more negative potentials; slope $\propto I_{peak}$ |
| FWHM vs $R_u$ | Progressive broadening, more pronounced for high RF |
| $I_{peak}$ vs $R_u$ | Slight decrease (charge redistribution) |
| SNR vs $R_u$ | Progressive degradation; moderate at 25 Hz, significant for $R_u > 500\;\Omega$ |

### 4.2 Detailed results

1. **$IR_{drop}$ vs $R_u$**: linear relationship for each (RF, Ni) combination. Slope proportional to $I_{peak}$.
2. **$E_{peak}$ vs $R_u$**: linear shift toward more negative potentials. Slope proportional to $I_{peak}$.
3. **FWHM vs $R_u$**: progressive broadening, more pronounced for high RF.
4. **$I_{peak}$ vs $R_u$**: slight decrease due to peak broadening (charge redistribution over a wider potential range).
5. **SNR vs $R_u$**: progressive degradation. The effect is moderate at 25 Hz because currents are low, but significant for $R_u > 500\;\Omega$.

### 4.3 Practical conclusion

At the reference frequency of 25 Hz, uncompensated resistance has a moderate effect on the biosensor signal, even at $R_u = 1000\;\Omega$. The $E_{peak}$ shift remains below 0.1 mV for nanoampere-level currents. The main effect is FWHM broadening, which reduces peak resolution and may affect the accuracy of the Gaussian fit used for metric extraction.
